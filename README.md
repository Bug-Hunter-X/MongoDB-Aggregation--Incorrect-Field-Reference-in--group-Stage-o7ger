# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Field Reference

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using an incorrect field name in the `$group` stage.

The bug is caused by referencing a field that does not exist or has a different name than expected within the `$group` stage, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code shows an aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents and sum a field. However, there is a typo or incorrect reference in the `$sum` operator, leading to an empty result instead of a meaningful aggregation.

## Solution
The solution corrects the field references within the `$group` stage to accurately match the field names in the collection documents. This results in the correct aggregation and the expected results.

## How to Reproduce

1. Set up a MongoDB instance.
2. Create a collection with sample documents.
3. Execute the code in `bug.js`.
4. Observe the unexpected empty result.
5. Execute the corrected code in `bugSolution.js`.
6. Observe the accurate aggregation result.
